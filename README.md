central limit test for coin flip experiment with different numbers of iteration. as it was expected, the result leans toward being Gaussian as the number of experiments increase. txt files include the data, the png file represents data for different number of iteration (100: blue, 1000: red, and 10000 yellow).
you're welcome :)
